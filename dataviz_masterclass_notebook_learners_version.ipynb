    "Before getting hands on, be reminded that in a corporate environment, you will be solicited by some client to solve one problem. To satisfy your client the most, it is important to keep the following in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Understand your client's context and needs**: here a list of non-exhaustive reasons you might be solicited for by your client:\n",
    "    * They may want some convincing data-driven arguments to support their ideas to top management\n",
    "    * They may want important insights to make the best data-oriented decision\n",
    "    * They may need to follow some chosen KPI to evaluate some performances (sales, traffic on a web-page, machine operations, ...)<br>\n",
    "Sometimes, your client have a clear idea of what they want. This could facilitate your work if you are provided the pertinent data to satisfy the request. If your client need is not so clear, this is not necessarily a problem. While exploring the data, you can give constant feedback on what can be tracked and propose some insights or KPI to follow. Interacting regularly with your client can help them understand better their needs and precise their request.\n",
    "* **Take your time to understand your data**: you will get through some recommendation on that later. Be sure to identify the data owner, who can provide you some clarification or extra data if needed. Note that the data owner is not necessarily your client.\n",
    "* **What is the expected deliverable?** Is your study a one-time only? Does your client need to interact with the data? Does your client need to be constantly checking the visualization? The answers to those questions are important to choose the most adapted way to your deliverable: a simple powerpoint? A report on a data visualization tool? A simple website regularly updated? Note that if the requested deliverable is a website, you might want to have the support of web developers.\n",
    "* **Be careful when making conclusion, especially when stablishing causality**: just because variables seem to increase or decrease simultaneously (statistically speaking, those variables are correlated), it does not necessarily mean there is a causality link between them, although this can be an interesting hypothesis to be investigated. It is always worth remembering: [correlation does necessarily not imply causation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation).\n",

An average of closest points or more sophisticated techniques? Maybe missing data concerns only some rows, which can then be discarded.
